# Saturday 75% Wheat Bread
### Ken Forkish
.column[
One loaf was great and the other didn't quite have the rise. Gave half of the good one to Tim and Wendy and the other half to Auntie. We ate the less good one.

# Maple Cinnamon Scones
### Mark Bittman
.column[
Nailed these. Great rise, really light and fluffy. The kids inhaled them. Really wet dough and took the full 12 minutes.

# Rosemary Feta Whole Wheat Scones
### Mark Bittman
Not as good as the first batch. A little drier dough that possibly was overworked and underbaked. Flavors were also too subtle. I used rosemary from the bush outside, but I should've used more.

### Ken Forkish
.column[
These seemed to come out really well. I gave one to Sarah for her birthday and saved the other for home.

# Overnight 100% White Bread
### Ken Forkish
.column[
My best bread yet. Huge overnight rise, big airpockets and an awesome crust. I baked it a touch under 50 minutes as I think the oven is hot. Gave one to Tim and Wendy and they were complimentary.

# Vanilla Latte Yellow Cake
### Mark Bittman
.column[
Katherine asked for a cake, and I let her pick one out. This was to be a simple yellow cake with an espresso buttercream frosting. The cake was overbaked and didn't rise enough, and I tried to frost it while it was still warm. Lots of lessons learned here. The frosting was the silver lining.
