# Saturday 75% Wheat Bread
### Ken Forkish
One loaf was great and the other didn't quite have the rise. Gave half of the good one to Tim and Wendy and the other half to Auntie. We ate the less good one.

# Maple Cinnamon Scones
### Mark Bittman
Nailed these. Great rise, really light and fluffy. The kids inhaled them. Really wet dough and took the full 12 minutes.

# Rosemary Feta Whole Wheat Scones
### Mark Bittman
Not as good as the first batch. A little drier dough that possibly was overworked and underbaked. Flavors were also too subtle. I used rosemary from the bush outside, but I should've used more.
