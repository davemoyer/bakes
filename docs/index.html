# Saturday 75% Wheat Bread
### Ken Forkish
.column[
One loaf was great and the other didn't quite have the rise. Gave half of the good one to Tim and Wendy and the other half to Auntie. We ate the less good one.

# Maple Cinnamon Scones
### Mark Bittman
.column[
Nailed these. Great rise, really light and fluffy. The kids inhaled them. Really wet dough and took the full 12 minutes.

# Rosemary Feta Whole Wheat Scones
### Mark Bittman
Not as good as the first batch. A little drier dough that possibly was overworked and underbaked. Flavors were also too subtle. I used rosemary from the bush outside, but I should've used more.

# Overnight 40% Wheat Bread
### Ken Forkish
These seemed to come out really well. I gave one to Sarah for her birthday and saved the other for home.

# Overnight 100% White Bread
### Ken Forkish

My best bread yet. Huge overnight rise, big airpockets and an awesome crust. I baked it a touch under 50 minutes as I think the oven is hot. Gave one to Tim and Wendy and they were complimentary.

# Vanilla Latte Yellow Cake
### Mark Bittman
.column[
Katherine asked for a cake, and I let her pick one out. This was to be a simple yellow cake with an espresso buttercream frosting. The cake was overbaked and didn't rise enough, and I tried to frost it while it was still warm. Lots of lessons learned here. The frosting was the silver lining.

# Harvest Bread with Poolish
### Ken Forkish
I ended up making four of these loaves and liked all of them. The wheat germ and bran seem to make it feel nuttier than it is with 90% white flour.

# White Bread with 80% Biga
### Ken Forkish
Really liked these loves: Tim called this his favorite. For one loaf I thought I sensed it burning, so I took off the cover early, which caused a weaker crust. The other, baked normally was great all around.

# Hob's 100% Whole Wheat Bread
### Ken Forkish
First try at one of Hob's loaves. Came out dry and a bit bland. I basked them in boules, used the dutch oven, and omitted the oil. I'm going to make it exactly as designed next time and knead a bit more.

# 50% Whole Wheat Bread with Biga
### Ken Forkish
These came out looking really good. Taste was solid - the interior was a little softer than I expected, but it made for good sandwich bread

# Harvest loaf with Poolish
### Ken Forkish
Needed bread for the week and tried to bake one in a loaf pan. The shaping caused it to come up a little lopsided, but otherwise the interior was fine for sandwich bread. The crust was a little too hard for Wally, but I think I may have overbaked it slightly.

# Strawberry Pie
### Mark Bittman
My first pie crust! Got some strawberries from the farmer's market and went to town. I made the dough and rested it for a couple hours. I probably didn't roll the base out far enough and may have mounded the berries a little too much - causing them to spill out of the slits.

# Carrot Cake
### Auntie's recipe
I nailed this. It was a Mother's Day affair, and it was soooo good.

# Challah
### King Arthur Flour
This looked great, but came out a little dark and dense. Probably overbaked and over-worked. I gave it to Tim for french toast and it didn't quite soak things up.

# Strawberry Rhubarb Pie
### Mark Bittman
Had some trouble with this crust where I  didn't press it solidly enough into the pan, which caused it to bubble during the blind bake. So I remade one crust, and then added the fruit to the hot crust after the second try at the blind bake. Everything ended up "OK" but not great.

# Challah #2
### King Arthur Flour
This was way better. Much better during kneading, and baked it for several minutes less. It was considerably softer, but still probably a bit dense for what it should be.

# Biscuits
### King Arthur Flour
Made a double batch of these for Tim to have biscuits and gravy, and for me to make some strawberry shortcake. Most had a decent rise, and the flavor was solid.

# Pain de Campagne
### Ken Forkish
These looked and tasted delicious. Not as airy as some other bakes, but seemed to match the expected image. The tanginess was really subtle - awesome.

# Bran Encrusted Levain
### Ken Forkish
These looked PRO. They tasted a bit more tangy than I expected, but it was hot and the levain might've gone nuts. Experimenting with 35 mins of cover on and 10 of cover off.

# 75% whole wheat levain
### Ken Forkish
Came out a little smaller and with less rise than I expected, but these seemed drier the whole time.
